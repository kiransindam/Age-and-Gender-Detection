# Age-and-Gender-Detection-Project
The "Age and Gender Detection Using Deep Learning" Flask project aims to build a web application that can accurately detect the age and gender of a person from an input image. The project leverages deep learning techniques to analyze facial features and make predictions. The web application will provide an intuitive user interface where users can upload images and get real-time predictions for age and gender.

## Key Features:
1)Image Upload: The web application allows users to upload images containing human faces for analysis.

2)Age Detection: The deep learning model will predict the age of the person in the uploaded image.model is trained on a large dataset of facial images with corresponding age labels.

3)Gender Detection: The model will also predict the gender of the person in the uploaded image as either male or female.

4)Real-Time Prediction: The system provides real-time predictions and displays the age and gender results immediately after image upload.

5)User-Friendly Interface: The Flask web application offers a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and interact with.

### Limitations:
1)Accuracy: The accuracy of age and gender prediction depends on the quality and diversity of the training data. The model may not always provide precise predictions, especially for images with challenging angles, lighting, or occlusions.

2)Face Detection: The system assumes that the input image contains only one face, and face detection is not a part of this project.

3) Age Range: The model's predictions might be limited to a specific age range, and its accuracy might decrease for age groups outside the training data.

#### Conclusion:
The "Age and Gender Detection" Flask project is an exciting application that demonstrates the capabilities of deep learning in analyzing facial features for age and gender prediction. The real-time web interface enhances user experience, making it easy for users to explore the system's predictions. However, the project also acknowledges its limitations in terms of accuracy and the need for proper data representation. With further improvements and advancements in deep learning and dataset diversity, the system's performance could be enhanced in the future.
